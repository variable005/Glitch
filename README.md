# GLITCH 1.0 — Cyberpunk Hackathon Portal

GLITCH 1.0 is a themed web experience created for a college hackathon event. Instead of a traditional event website, GLITCH introduces a narrative-driven, broken-mainframe aesthetic where the event appears to have crashed and users are left digging through corrupted system fragments to uncover data such as rankings, winners, and final messages.

The site presents the hackathon results as a simulated system failure, blending UI animations, typography, video backgrounds, glitch artifacts, and micro-interactions.

## Features

- Fullscreen galaxy/holographic video background with color grading
- Glitched hero title with chromatic aberration layers
- Custom cyber-themed cursor with hover states and motion easing
- Collapsed navigation with responsive hamburger transformation
- “Core Dump” section that reveals winners as pseudo memory fragments
- Developer note section presented as a secure channel output
- Scanline and flicker animation effects for retro terminal feel
- Pure CSS styling with GSAP-powered micro-animations
- Minimal sections to reinforce the unstable system narrative
- Mobile responsive design

## Visual Style and Theme

The visual identity draws from cyberpunk HCI interfaces and broken-system aesthetics, using:

- Monospace and aerospace fonts
- CRT-inspired contrast and scanlines
- Chromatic glitch overlays
- Red/teal accent duality
- Restrained UI components
- Theme-consistent messaging and micro-copy

## Technologies Used

- HTML for structure
- CSS3 for layout, theming, animation, and responsive behavior
- GSAP for cursor and button motion interactions
- Video assets for atmospheric background
- No backend or build tools required
